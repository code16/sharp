# Multi-Forms

Let's say you want to handle different variants for an Entity, but in one Entity List.

For instance, maybe you are a car-seller and you want to display all sold cars on an Entity List. Easy enough, you create a `Car` entity, list and form. But now let's say you want the to handle different form fields for cars with an internal combustion engine and those with an electric engine; you can of course use a single form and [conditional display](building-entity-form.md#conditional-display) to achieve this, but in a case where there are many differences, the best option is to split the Entity in two (or more) Forms. That's Multi-Form.

## Write the Form classes

Following up the car example, we would write two Form classes: `CombustionCarForm` and `ElectricCarForm`, maybe. They are regular `SharpForm` classes, as [described here](building-entity-form.md).

Note that you'll probably be able to regroup some common code in a trait or by inheritance: it's up to you.

Same goes for [Validators](building-entity-form.md#input-validation), if needed.


## Configuration

Once the classes are written, you must declare the forms in the sharp config file. So instead of:

```php
// config/sharp.php

return [
    "entities" => [
        "car" => [
            "list" => \App\Sharp\CarSharpList::class,
            "form" => \App\Sharp\CarSharpForm::class,
            "validator" => \App\Sharp\CarSharpValidator::class
        ]
    ]
];
```

You'll have something like:

```php
// config/sharp.php

return [
    "entities" => [
        "car" => [
            "list" => \App\Sharp\CarSharpList::class,
            "forms" => [
              "combustion" => [
                "form" => \App\Sharp\CombustionCarSharpForm::class,
                "validator" => \App\Sharp\CombustionCarSharpValidator::class,
              ],
              "electric" => [
                "form" => \App\Sharp\ElectricCarSharpForm::class,
                "validator" => \App\Sharp\ElectricCarSharpValidator::class,
              ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

At this stage, you need only one more thing: configure the Entity List to handle Multi-Form.


## The Entity List

Now we want to "merge" our Car entity in the Entity List, and allow the user to create or edit either a combustion or an electric car.

To achieve this final step, you'll have to first update the global configuration to add a label and an optional icon to each type:

```php
// config/sharp.php

return [
    "entities" => [
        "car" => [
            "list" => \App\Sharp\CarSharpList::class,
            "forms" => [
              "combustion" => [
                "label" => "Combustion car",
                "icon" => "fa-truck"
                [...]
              ],
              "electric" => [
                "label" => "Electric car",
                "icon" => "fa-car",
                [...]
              ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

This allows the "new" button to display a dropdown with each type, leading to the right Form.

Last, you must configure an instance attribute to disambiguate each type: each instance must have this attribute valuated either with "electric" or "combustion", in our example.

You declare this attribute in the Entity List `buildListConfig()` method:

```php
function buildListConfig()
{
    $this->setSearchable()
        ->setDefaultSort("name", "asc")
        ->setMultiformAttribute("engine")
        ->setPaginated();
}
```

Here, the `engine` attribute must be filled for each Car instance. So how you do that? Obviously, the first way is to keep the same attribute you use in your database: in many cases, you already have this `engine` value in a column. If not, or if the value is something less readable (an ID for instance), use a [custom transformer](how-to-transform-data.md):

```php
function getListData(EntityListQueryParams $params)
{
    return $this
        ->setCustomTransformer("engine", function($value, $car) {
            return $car->motor == "EV" ? "electric" : "combustion";
        })
        ->transform(Car::paginate(30));
}
```

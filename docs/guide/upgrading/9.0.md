# Upgrading from 8.x to 9.x

## Get new assets, clear cache

This is true for every update: be sure to grab the latest assets and to clear the view cache:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Code16\Sharp\SharpServiceProvider" --tag=assets
php artisan view:clear
```

## Deprecated methods have been removed

- Entity List: deprecated `buildListFields()` and `buildListLayout()` were removed, use `buildList()` instead
- Form: deprecated `delete()` method was removed (since it was moved to show / entity list in 8.x)

## New way to configure Sharp, via a dedicated builder class

The `config/sharp.php` file was entirely removed in favor of a dedicated builder class. This is not a breaking change since the config file is still supported, but deprecated, so you are encouraged to migrate to the new builder class.

To migrate, you should first create a new Service Provider which extends `Code16\Sharp\SharpAppServiceProvider` and implements the `configureSharp()` method:

```php
use Code16\Sharp\SharpAppServiceProvider;

class MySharpServiceProvider extends SharpAppServiceProvider
{
    protected function configureSharp(SharpConfigBuilder $config): void
    {
        $config
            ->setName('My project')
            ->addEntity('posts', PostEntity::class)
            // [...]
    }
}
```

Report all you configuration using the API of this new `SharpConfigBuilder` class. It should be pretty straightforward, as all the methods are named after the config keys they replace. For example:

In 8.x:

```php
// Old config/sharp.php
return [
    'name' => 'Demo project',
    'custom_url_segment' => 'sharp',
    'display_breadcrumb' => true,
    'entities' => [
        'posts' => \App\Sharp\Entities\PostEntity::class,
    ],

    'global_filters' => fn () => auth()->id() === 1 ? [] : [\App\Sharp\DummyGlobalFilter::class],

    'search' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'placeholder' => 'Search for posts or authors...',
        'engine' => \App\Sharp\AppSearchEngine::class,
    ],

    'menu' => \App\Sharp\SharpMenu::class,

    // [...]
];
```

In 9.x:

```php
class MySharpServiceProvider extends SharpAppServiceProvider
{
    protected function configureSharp(SharpConfigBuilder $config): void
    {
        $config
            ->setName('Demo project')
            ->setCustomUrlSegment('sharp')
            ->setDisplayBreadcrumb()
            ->addEntity('posts', PostEntity::class)
            ->when(
                auth()->id() === 1,
                fn(SharpConfigBuilder $config) => $config->addGlobalFilter(DummyGlobalFilter::class)
            )
            ->enableGlobalSearch(AppSearchEngine::class, 'Search for posts or authors...')
            ->setMenu(SharpMenu::class)
            // [...]
    }
}
```

::: warning
Be sure to [register this new Service Provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers#registering-providers) in your app.

## New middleware to declare

Due to migration to inertia, two middleware must be added to the config. 

::: 
if you migrated to the new config builder class, you should be ok unless you have explicitly overridden the whole middleware list.
:::

Here is the impact on the deprecated config file:

```php
// config/sharp.php

return [
    'middleware' => [
        //...
        'web' => [
            // ...
            \Code16\Sharp\Http\Middleware\HandleSharpErrors::class,
            \Code16\Sharp\Http\Middleware\HandleInertiaRequests::class,
        ],
    ],
]
```

## Page Alerts (aka global messages) need a substantial rewrite

This part has been entirely rewritten, and will need substantial changes in your code.

In 8.x and below, you were asked to configure page alerts in the `buildConfig()` method; and if your page alert was displaying dynamic data, you had to use a custom transformer to inject the data in the page alert. All of this was removed, in favor of a much simpler "back only" system. Here’s an example of a page alert in a Show Page (this is the same in Form, Dashboard, Entity List, Embed and Command cases):

```php
class MyShow extends SharpShow
{
    // [...]
    
    protected function buildPageAlert(PageAlert $pageAlert): void
    {
        $pageAlert
            ->setLevelInfo()
            ->setMessage(function (array $data) {
                return $data['is_planned']
                    ? 'This post is planned for publication, on ' . $data['published_at']
                    : null;
            });
    }
}
```

As you can see, this new `buildPageAlert()` method takes a `PageAlert` object as parameter to work with. You'll have access to the `$data` array returned by your `find()` or `getListData()` method, to inject dynamic data in your page alert if needed. Vue templates are no longer handed, as the page alert is now rendered on the back only.

See [global page alert documentation](../page-alerts.md) for more detail.

## New validation system (and deprecation of the old one)

The validation system was odd, for legacy reasons.
In 9.x, it has been rewritten to be in phase with Laravel and to be more consistent:

- validation rules can now be defined in a `rules()` method of the form / command class,
- or with a `->validate($data, $rules)` call before update / store.
- The `$formValidatorClass` property usage, in a `SharpForm`, is now deprecated (you are strongly encouraged to migrate to the `rules()` method instead).

This version brings two huge benefits (besides the fact that it's clearer):

- the "delayed creation" thing is gone: the `{id}` parameter in a `SharpFormUploadField` storageBasePath isn't anymore an issue in creation case as Sharp will no longer call the `update()` method twice.
- Validation is now called AFTER data formatters, even in `SharpForm` (it was already the case with `Command`).

Breaking changes: the 8.x and below validation is still allowed, but deprecated. If you decide to migrate (and you should), pay attention to:

- remove special workarounds you may have done to handle the "delayed creation" thing,
- remove the `.text` suffix you may have added for `SharpFormEditorField` validation rules.

## Form and Show layout methods were renamed (old ones are deprecated)

The `->withSingleField()` method was deprecated, in favor of:

- `->withField(string $fieldKey)` for simple fields
- `->withListField(string $fieldKey, Closure $subLayoutCallback)` for List fields, which requires a sub-layout handled by a callback.

The method `->withFields(string ...$fieldKeys)`, used for multiple fields layout, remains unchanged.

## Entity List's `setWidth()` method as a new signature (non-breaking change: old signature is still supported)

The `->setWith($width)` method now expects a percentage value, expressed as a string (eg: `'20'` or `'20%'`), a float (eg: `.2` for 20%) or an integer (eg: `20` for 20%). The old signature use to accept a 1 to 12 integer (12-grid): it is still supported (Sharp will transform a 6 in 50%), but deprecated, and you are strongly encourage to migrate to the new signature.

## Methods to handle Entity List columns width on small screen were deprecated

The `->setWithOnSmallScreen($width)` and `->setWithOnSmallScreenFill()` methods were deprecated, because they are no more used in the new front table UI system. You can safely remove them, Sharp will rely on the `setWidth($width)` method, or, even easier, will deduce width based on content like a regular table.

The `->hideOnSmallScreens()` method remains.

## Related models handing in custom transformers was fixed (and potentially breaking)

This bug fix potentially brings a breaking change: if you were using a custom transformer to handle related models, you may have to update it.

Here’s code which will work in Sharp 8.x and below:

```php
$this
    ->setCustomTransformer('customer:name', fn ($value, $instance, $attribute) { 
        return $instance->customer->name; // $instance is the Order
    })
    ->transform(Order::find(1))
```

Is has to be rewritten like this in Sharp 9.x:

```php
$this
    ->setCustomTransformer('customer:name', fn ($value, $instance, $attribute) { 
        return $instance->name; // $instance is the Customer, as it should be.
    })
    ->transform(Order::find(1))
```

The main difference is that the `$instance` parameter refers to the related model, not the main model anymore. To summarize:

In 8.x:

```php
$value: 'Joe Doe'
$instance: // the Order instance
$attribute: 'customer:name'
```

In 9.x:

```php
$value: 'Joe Doe'
$instance: // the **Customer** instance
$attribute: 'name'
```

## Form and Show Fields are now formatted even if you don’t transform them

This shouldn’t cause any trouble, as this is a fix, but it could break unorthodox code: field formatters (which are used to format the field value for the frontend) are now properly and always called before displaying data to the front, even if you don’t transform your data with `$this->transform()` method.

## All filters must be declared in order to be used

In Sharp 8.x it was possible, in an Embedded Entity List (EEL) case, to use a filter without declaring it. This was a kind of bug, and has been fixed in 9.x: all filters must be declared in the `getFilters()` method.

Consider this code in 8.x, where we have a `PostShow` that embeds a `PostBlockList` as an EEL:

```php
class PostShow extends SharpShow
{
    protected function buildShowFields(FieldsContainer $showFields): void
    {
        $showFields
            ->addField(SharpShowTextField::make('title')->setLabel('Title'))
            ->addField(
                SharpShowEntityListField::make('blocks')
                    ->setLabel('Blocks')
                    ->hideFilterWithValue('post', fn($instanceId) => $instanceId)
            );
    }
    // ...
}

class PostBlockList extends SharpEntityList
{
    // ...

    protected function getFilters(): ?array
    {
        return [
            // Nothing there
        ];
    }

    public function getListData(): array|Arrayable
    {
        return $this->transform(
            PostBlock::query()
                ->where('post_id', $this->queryParams->filterFor('post'))
                ->get()
        );
    }
}
```

We can see that `PostBlockList` does not define any Filter, but uses one in the `getListData()` method, valued by the `PostShow` via `hideFilterWithValue()`. In 9.x, this won't work as the Filter must be declared in the `getFilters()` method. There is a new way to quickly declare such Filters that are not meant to be shown to the user, `HiddenFiler`:

In 9.x

```php
use \Code16\Sharp\EntityList\Filters\HiddenFilter;

class PostBlockList extends SharpEntityList
{
    // ...

    protected function getFilters(): ?array
    {
        return [
            HiddenFilter::make('post')
        ];
    }
    
    // ... The rest is the same
}
```

You can of course instead declare a real Filter.

## `SharpFormUploadField`’s image related methods were renamed

This isn't a breaking change, since the old methods are still available, but deprecated. You should migrate to the new methods:

- `setFileFilterImage()` -> `setImageOnly()`
- `setCropRatio()` = `setImageCropRatio()`
- `shouldOptimizeImage()` = `setImageOptimize()`
- `setTransformable()` = `setImageTransformable()`
- `setCompactThumbnail()` = `setImageCompactThumbnail()`

and in addition:

- `setFilterFilter()` -> `setAllowedExtensions()`

See [full documentation here](../form-fields/upload.md).

## The API for embedded uploads in Editor field was rewritten

The `SharpFormEditorField` no longer has all the upload-related methods directly in the class. Instead, you must use a new `SharpFormEditorEmbedUpload` builder class, passed as a parameter to the `allowUploads()` method.

In 8.x:

```php
// in a SharpForm
public function buildFormFields(FieldsContainer $formFields): void
{
    $formFields->addField(
        SharpFormEditorField::make('content')
            ->setMaxLength(1000)
            ->setToolbar([
                SharpFormEditorField::B,
                SharpFormEditorField::A,
                SharpFormEditorField::UPLOAD,
            ])
            ->setStorageDisk('local')
            ->setStorageBasePath('data/posts/{id}/embed'),
        )
    );
}
```

In 9.x:

```php
// in a SharpForm
public function buildFormFields(FieldsContainer $formFields): void
{
    $formFields->addField(
        SharpFormEditorField::make('content')
            ->setMaxLength(1000)
            ->setToolbar([
                SharpFormEditorField::B,
                SharpFormEditorField::A,
                SharpFormEditorField::UPLOAD,
            ])
            ->allowUploads(
                SharpFormEditorEmbedUpload::make()
                    ->setStorageDisk('local')
                    ->setStorageBasePath('data/posts/{id}/embed')
            );
    );
}
```

See [full documentation here](../form-fields/editor.md).

## New markup for Embedded uploads (in Editor field)

If you are using `SharpFormEditorField` uploads, you will need migrate `<x-sharp-image>` and `<x-sharp-file>` elements in the content, meaning in the database. Sharp provides a helper trait intended to be used in your migration like this:

```php
use Code16\Sharp\Form\Eloquent\Migrations\MigrateContentsForSharp9;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

new class extends Migration
{
    use MigrateContentsForSharp9;

    public function up(): void
    {
        $this->updateContentOf(DB::table('posts'), ['content']);
    }
}
```

## Thumbnails custom filters must be refactored to Modifiers

First, if you defined custom filters classes for your thumbnails, you must refactor it to the new ThumbnailModifier API, which is very close:

In 8.x

```php
class MyFilter extends ThumbnailFilter
{
    public function applyFilter(Image $image): Image
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In 9.x

```php
use Code16\Sharp\Form\Eloquent\Uploads\Thumbnails\ThumbnailModifier;
use Intervention\Image\Interfaces\ImageInterface;

class MyModifier extends ThumbnailModifier
{
    public function apply(ImageInterface $image): ImageInterface
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

And second, in 9.x you can’t pass modifier's parameters as an array anymore:

In 8.x

```php
$book->cover->thumbnail(100, 100, ['fit'=>['w'=>100, 'h'=>100]]);
```

In 9.x

```php
$book->cover->thumbnail(100, 100, [new FitModifier(100, 100)]);

// or with the new fluent API
$book->cover->thumbnail()
    ->addModifier(new FitModifier(100, 100))
    ->make();
```

## `SharpAuthenticationCheckHandler` is now deprecated in favor of `viewSharp` Gate

The use of a `SharpAuthenticationCheckHandler` is now deprecated, and will be entirely removed in a future version. You should migrate your handler to a Gate:

In 8.x:

```php
class MySharpAuthenticationCheckHandler implements SharpAuthenticationCheckHandler
{
    public function check(Authenticatable $user): bool;
    {
        return $user->is_sharp_admin;
    }
}
```

In 9.x:

```php
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    // [...]

    public function boot(): void
    {
        Gate::define('viewSharp', fn ($user) => $user->is_sharp_admin);
    }
}
```

::: tip
You should place this code in the new Sharp dedicated Service Provider you will create to configure your Sharp app, overriding the `declareAccessGate()` method. See [the dedicated documentation](../authentication#global-access-gate).
:::

Next, the `sharp.auth.check_handler` config key can be safely removed from your `config/sharp.php` file (in case you have not yet migrated to the dedicated builder class, see above), along with the `SharpAuthenticationCheckHandler` implementation class.

## New performance optimization for Commands and Policies in Entity List (n+1)

This is not a breaking change, in fact you can ignore this step entirely, but since it's can lead to a significative performance boost, this is worth mentioning: you can now quite easily implement a [caching mechanism of instances for your Commands and Policies in Entity List](../avoid-n1-queries-in-entity-lists.md).

# Upload

Class: `Code16\Sharp\Form\Fields\SharpFormUploadField`

## General configuration

You can define the temp disk and directory where files will be stored until they are moved to the final folder, as well as a global max file size (which can be overriden by each field). Here are the default values:

```php
class SharpServiceProvider extends SharpAppServiceProvider
{
    protected function configureSharp(SharpConfigBuilder $config): void
    {
        $config
            ->configureUploads(
                uploadDisk: 'local',
                uploadDirectory: 'tmp',
                globalMaxFileSize: 5,
                keepOriginalImageOnTransform: true
            )
            // [...]
    }
}
```

The fourth argument, `keepOriginalImageOnTransform`, is a boolean that defines if the original image should be kept when a transformation is applied on it (meaning that transformations are stored and applied on-the-fly: this is transparent when using Sharp’s [built-in way to handle uploads](../sharp-uploads.md). It can be overriden by each field (see below).

## Field Configuration

### `setStorageDisk(string $storageDisk)`

Set the destination storage disk (as configured in Laravel’s `config/filesystem.php` config file).

### `setStorageBasePath(string|Closure $storageBasePath)`

Set the destination base storage path.

::: warning
If you want to use a `{id}` special placeholder to add the instance id in the path (for instance: `$field->setStorageBasePath('/users/{id}/avatar')`), you must be the Eloquent case, leveraging `Code16\Sharp\Form\Eloquent\WithSharpFormEloquentUpdater` (see [Eloquent form](../building-form#eloquent-case-where-the-magic-happens))
:::

### `setStorageTemporary()`

Keep the file only in the upload directory/disk (configured [here](#general-configuration)). `setStorageDisk()` and `setStorageBasePath()` will be ignored.

### `setAllowedExtensions(string|array $allowedExtensions)`

Define the allowed file extensions. 

For instance: `$field->setAllowedExtensions(['pdf', 'zip'])`

## Field Configuration in image case

### `setImageOnly(bool $imageOnly = true)`

When an upload field is configured to accept only images:
- the field will be forced to accept only images (allowed extensions set to "jpg, png, gif, svg, webp, bmp" by default),
- the uploaded file will be validated as an image (see below for more options),
- a thumbnail will be generated for the uploaded image.

### `setImageTransformable(bool $transformable = true, ?bool $transformKeepOriginal = null)`

Allow the user to crop or rotate the visual, after the upload.  
The argument `$transformKeepOriginal` overrides the global config (which is `true` by default).

With `$transformKeepOriginal` set to true, the original file will remain unchanged, meaning the transformations will be stored apart: using the [built-in way to handle uploads](../sharp-uploads.md), it's transparent. Otherwise, see the Formatter part below.

### `setImageCropRatio(string $ratio, array $croppableFileTypes = null)`

Set a ratio constraint to uploaded images, formatted like this: `width:height`. For instance: `16:9`, or `1:1`.

When a crop ratio is set, any uploaded picture will be auto-cropped (centered).

The second argument, `$croppableFileTypes`, provide a way to limit the crop configuration to a list of image files extensions. For instance, it can be useful to define a crop for jpg and png, but not for gif because it will destroy animation.

### `setImageCompactThumbnail(bool $compactThumbnail = true)`

If true and if the upload has a thumbnail, it is limited to 60px high (to compact in a list item, for instance).

### `setImageOptimizeImage(bool $imageOptimize = true)`

If true, some optimization will be applied on the uploaded images (in order to reduce files weight). It relies on spatie's [image-optimizer](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer). Please note that you will need some of these packages on your system:
- [JpegOptim](http://freecode.com/projects/jpegoptim)
- [Optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)
- [Pngquant 2](https://pngquant.org/)
- [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo)
- [Gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/)
- [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/precompiled)

Check their documentation for [more instructions](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer#optimization-tools) on how to install.

## Validation

Notice that `setAllowedExtensions()` and `setImageOnly()` already are basic validation rules that Sharp will use both on the front-end and in the back-end.

But there are a few more rules available:

### `setMaxFileSize(int $maxFileSizeInMB)` and `setMinFileSize(int $minFileSizeInMB)`

Set the maximum and minimum (even if this is a rare use-case) file size in MB.

### `setImageDimensionConstraints(Illuminate\Validation\Rules\Dimensions $dimensions)`

Set image dimension constraints, leveraging the dedicated Laravel validation rule (see [the documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-dimensions)).

## Formatter

First, let's mention that Sharp provides an Eloquent built-in solution for uploads with the `SharpUploadModel` class, as [detailed here](../sharp-uploads.md), which greatly simplify the work (to be clear: it will handle everything from storage to image transformations).

Here's the documentation for the **not built-in solution**:

### `toFront`

The front expects an array with these keys:

```php
[
    'name' => '', // The file name
    'path' => '', // Relative file path
    'disk' => '', // Storage disk name
    'thumbnail' => '', // URL of the thumbnail (if image, obviously)
    'size' => x, // Size in bytes
    'filters' => [ // Transformations applied to the (image) file
        'crop' => [
            'x' => x,
            'y' => y,
            'width' => w,
            'height' => h,
        ],
        'rotate' => [
            'angle' => a,
        ]
    ]
]
```

The formatter can't handle it automatically, it is too project-specific. You'll have to provide this in a custom transformer ([see full documentation](../how-to-transform-data.md)) like this:

```php
function find($id): array
{
    return $this
        ->setCustomTransformer('picture',
            function($value, $product, $attribute) {
                return [
                    'name' => basename($product->picture->name),
                    'path' => $product->picture->name,
                    'disk' => 's3',
                    'thumbnail' => /* thumbnail URL */,
                    'size' => $product->picture->size,
                    'filters' => $product->picture->filters
                ];
            }
        )
        ->transform(Product::find($id));
}
```

Do note that the thumbnail should comply to following rules: be at least 200x200 pixels, and more importantly it must apply the transformations defined by the filters if there is some. 

### `fromFront`

There are four cases:

#### newly uploaded file

The formatter must return an array like this:

```php
[
    'file_name' => '', // Target file path (relative)
    'size' => x, // File size in bytes
    'mime_type' => '', // File mime type
    'disk' => '', // Target storage disk name
    'filters' => [ // Transformations applied to the (image) file
        'crop' => [
            'x' => x,
            'y' => y,
            'width' => w,
            'height' => h,
        ],
        'rotate' => [
            'angle' => a,
        ]
    ]
];
```

It's up to you then to store any of these values in a DB or elsewhere.

Using the `Code16\Sharp\Form\Eloquent\WithSharpFormEloquentUpdater`, you will probably reach a solution like this:

```php
function update($id, array $data)
{
    $instance = $id ? Product::findOrFail($id) : new Product;

    $this->ignore('picture')->save($instance, $data);

    // Then handle $data['picture'] here
}
```

#### existing transformed image

In this case, the image was already handled in a previous post, and was then transformed (cropped, or rotated). The formatter will simply return and array with one `filters` key:

```php
[
    'filters' => [
        'crop' => [
            'x' => x,
            'y' => y,
            'width' => w,
            'height' => h,
        ],
        'rotate' => [
            'angle' => a,
        ]
    ]
];
```

Then you'll have to catch and store that if needed.

#### deleted file

The formatter will return `null` (note that the file **will not** be deleted from the storage).

#### existing and unchanged file

The formatter will return **an empty array**.

## Configure files jobs

Sharp handle files in jobs (copy / move and transformation). You can configure how these job should be dispatched:

```php
class SharpServiceProvider extends SharpAppServiceProvider
{
    protected function configureSharp(SharpConfigBuilder $config): void
    {
        $config
            ->configureUploads(
                fileHandingQueue: 'default',
                fileHandlingQueueConnection: 'sync',
            )
            // [...]
    }
}
```

Queue and connection should be [properly configured](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).

**Sharp is a content management framework built for Laravel as a package**, which provides great help to build a CMS section in a project with a clean UI and DX in mind. Sharp is driven by code: everything is manageable through a clean and documented PHP API, using Laravel conventions and coding style. It intends to avoid code adherence ‚Äî the project should not have any knowledge of it ‚Äî and is data-agnostic, meaning it does not have any expectations from the persistence layer.

Sharp for Laravel is actively maintained and developed and is used in all kinds of projects, from content-driven websites to e-commerce platforms and API backends.

Sharp intends to provide a clean solution to the following needs:
- create, update or delete any structured data of the project, handling validation and errors;
- display, search, sort or filter data;
- execute custom commands on one instance, a selection or all instances;
- handle authorizations and validation;
- all without writing a line of front code, and using a clean API in the PHP app.

Sharp needs Laravel 11+ and PHP 8.3+.

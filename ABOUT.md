# About Sharp

Sharp is built and is maintained by [Code16](http://code16.fr), a French web agency located in Strasbourg. More precisely, inside Code16, Philippe Lonchampt and Antoine Guingand are working hard on this.

The Sharp name itself is a reference to Quincy Sharp, which is the director of the Arkham Asylum in some Batman universe, just because Code16 is part of a group of talented people named [Gotham](http://www.gothamscm.com/) in honour of [our building](https://www.google.fr/maps/@48.5840255,7.7423656,3a,75y,187.52h,113.63t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFTtlI_qDjKuXKM9yMiV7ZQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).

Sharp is and will stay open source. It's a Laravel project built with Inertia, Tailwind CSS, Vue.js and Shadcn.
